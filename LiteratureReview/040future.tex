In this paper, we investigated in detail about the different models that have been designed for event and argument extraction. Even though a lot of work has been done in this field, we feel there is a lack of focus on extending these models to build automatic question answering systems based on the events extracted. For instance, there is no system,whyen given a textbook in biology as input, extracts different high level processes involved and is capable of answering questions that involve the different events, its prerequisites, entities involved, output, and its temporal relation to other events. Developing such a system would find application in a multitude of areas in this age of information explosion. To start with, it could help students to look for information in text books or encyclopedias without having to go through them page by page. There is also a huge amount of data available in the web, but unless we have an efficient event extraction system, most of it will lie unusable. Of course, we cannot rely fully on the data available from the web, but again, we can use different heuristics to build confidence on the data extracted as we see more supporting evidence, for instance.
