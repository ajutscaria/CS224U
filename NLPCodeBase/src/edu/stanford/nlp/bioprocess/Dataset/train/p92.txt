The cisternal maturation model proposes that the Golgi cisternae themselves "mature," moving from the cis to the trans face while carrying some proteins along. In addition, some vesicles recycle enzymes that had been carried forward in moving cisternae, transporting them "backward" to a less mature region where their functions are needed.
