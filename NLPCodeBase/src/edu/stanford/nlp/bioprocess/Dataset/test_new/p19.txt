Following enzymatic degradation of the mRNA, a second DNA strand, complementary to the first, is synthesized by DNA polymerase. The resulting double-stranded DNA is called complementary DNA (cDNA). To create a library, the researchers must now modify the cDNA by adding restriction enzyme recognition sequences at each end. Then the cDNA is inserted into vector DNA in a manner similar to the insertion of genomic DNA fragments.
