In the last ten years, next-generation sequencing techniques have been developed that do not rely on chain termination. Instead, a single template strand is immobilized, and reagents are added that allow so-called sequencing by synthesis of a complementary strand, one nucleotide at a time. A chemical trick enables electronic monitors to identify which of the four nucleotides is added, allowing determination of the sequence.
