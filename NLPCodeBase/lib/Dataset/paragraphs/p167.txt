The restriction enzyme in this example (called EcoRI) recognizes a specific six-base-pair sequence, the restriction site, and makes staggered cuts in the sugar-phosphate backbones within this sequence, producing fragments with sticky ends. Any fragments with complementary sticky ends can base-pair, including the two original fragments. If the fragments come from different DNA molecules, the ligated product is recombinant DNA.
