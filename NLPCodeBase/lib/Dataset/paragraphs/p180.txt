By using probes with different nucleotide sequences in different experiments, researchers can screen the collection of bacterial clones for different genes. After we've identified the location of a clone carrying the beta-globin gene, we can grow some cells from that colony in liquid culture in a large tank and then easily isolate many copies of the gene for our studies. We can also use the cloned gene as a probe to identify similar or identical genes in DNA from other sources, such as other species of birds.
