Many early animal embryos contain stem cells capable of giving rise to differentiated embryonic cells of any type. Stem cells can be isolated from early embryos at a stage called the blastula stage or its human equivalent, the blastocyst stage (Figure 20.21). In culture, these embryonic stem (ES) cells reproduce indefinitely; and depending on culture conditions, they can be made to differentiate into a wide variety of specialized cells, including even eggs and sperm.
