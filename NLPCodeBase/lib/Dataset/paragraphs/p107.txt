In E. coli, the process of cell division is initiated when the DNA of the bacterial chromosome begins to replicate at a specific place on the chromosome called the origin of replication, producing two origins. As the chromosome continues to replicate, one origin moves rapidly toward the opposite end of the cell (Figure 12.12). While the chromosome is replicating, the cell elongates. When replication is complete and the bacterium has reached about twice its initial size, its plasma membrane pinches inward, dividing the parent E. coli cell into two daughter cells.
