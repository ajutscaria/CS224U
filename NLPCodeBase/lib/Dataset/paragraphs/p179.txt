Cells from each clone are applied to a special nylon membrane. Each membrane has room for thousands of clones (many more than are shown here), so only a few membranes are needed to hold samples of all the clones in the library. This set of membranes is an arrayed library that can be screened for a specific gene using a labeled probe. Here the label is a radioactive nucleotide, but other labels are also commonly linked covalently to the probe nucleotides. These include fluorescent tags or enzymes that can produce either a colored or luminescent product.
