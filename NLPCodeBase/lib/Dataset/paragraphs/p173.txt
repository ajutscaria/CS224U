&#x278D; The DNA mixture is then added to bacteria that have a mutation in the lacZ gene on their own chromosome, making them unable to hydrolyze lactose or X-gal. Under suitable experimental conditions, the cells take up foreign DNA by transformation (see p. 306). Some cells acquire a recombinant plasmid carrying a gene, while others may take up a nonrecombinant plasmid, a fragment of noncoding hummingbird DNA, or nothing at all.
