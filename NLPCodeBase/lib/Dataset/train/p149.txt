Stabilizing selection (Figure 23.13c) acts against both extreme phenotypes and favors intermediate variants. This mode of selection reduces variation and tends to maintain the status quo for a particular phenotypic character. For example, the birth weights of most human babies lie in the range of 3-4 kg (6.6-8.8 pounds); babies who are either much smaller or much larger suffer higher rates of mortality.
