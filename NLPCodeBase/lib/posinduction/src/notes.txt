Notes for debugging etc.


It seems to work ok.

I should also evaluate it with perplexity here;

compare the clusters obtained with the good ones.



and then smooth it a little 


---------------------------

Compare the Neyessen with random intialisation and


try only applying morphological information to rare words.



tag the test corpus and look at the mi, particularly with the zero words


-------------

Merging doesn't look good.

Stop

-------------------

Plot the MI against the number of words i.e. 100,000 200,000 etc...

try plotting the MI against counts for freuqnecy 1-10
log scale for lots of different languages.

HMM try constring it to have entropy < x

ML subject to globale constraint of entropy
