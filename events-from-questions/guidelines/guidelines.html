  <li>Introduction  We have the ability to read text that describes a biological process (that is, a collection of inter-connected events that lead to an end result) and answer complex questions about the relationships between the events. Our goal is to develop systems that can automatically answer complex biology AP style questions in such a reading comprehension setting. We will use a hand created corpus of questions associated with text to train and evaluate the systems.</li>
  <li>Generating questions and answers  The goal is to generate multiple-choice questions about biological processes that are described in a paragraph of text. The questions should focus on the events and entities participating in the process. Consider the following paragraph (from the textbook /Biology/ by Campbell and Reece) as an example:</li>
  <li>Guidelines for generating questions and answers We are primarily interested in questions that depend on the inter-relationships between events. An event can be a /subevent/ or a /super-event/ of another one. Additionally, an event can /enable/, /cause/ or /prevent/ another one. Note that these *event-event* relations often imply a temporal ordering between them. For example, if event e_1 causes an event e_2

      <li>Other guidelines  1. Each question should be associated with two answers, where only     one is unambiguously correct.</li>
