\begin{abstract}
Reasoning over processes is fundamental for language understanding applications such as Question Answering. In this paper we propose a method for extracting relations between events in a process. We annotate 150 paragraphs describing biological processes and show that by taking advantage of the global structure of a process we can substantially improve performance. In addition, we release our data set.
