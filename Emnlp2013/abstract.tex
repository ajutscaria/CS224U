Biological processes are complex phenomena that involve a series of events and multiple participating entities. Teaching computers to read and understand textual descriptions of biological processes is a necessary  (maybe talk about reasoning?). In this paper, we present the task of \emph{process extraction}, in which process events and their relations are automatically extracted from text. 
We first describe a novel graph representation for processes that includes a rich set of temporal, causal and co-reference relations between process events, and then characterize the structural properties of processes, such as \emph{connectivity} of the process graph. These properties allow us to extract the relations between process events by performing joint inference over multiple relations over the graph structure.
We demonstrate empirically that taking process structure into account significantly improves performance over a data set containing 150 descriptions of biological processes. We release this novel data set for the benefit of the research community.
