Reasoning over processes is an important part of language understanding, and crucial for semantic applications such as questions answering. In this paper, we present the task of \emph{process extraction}, in which process events and their relations are extracted from text. We first describe a novel graph representation for processes that includes a rich set of temporal, causal and co-reference relations between process events, and then characterize the structural properties of processes, such as \emph{connectivity} of the process graph. We develop a method for predicting event-event relations in processes that exploits these structural properties by performing joint inference over the graph structure and rich relation set. We demonstrate empirically that taking process structure into account significantly improves performance over a data set containing 150 descriptions of biological processes. We release this novel data set for the benefit of the research community.
