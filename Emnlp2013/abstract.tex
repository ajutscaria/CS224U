Biological processes describe complex temporal and causal relations between a series of events and multiple participating entities. 
Understanding of process structures is crucial for applications such as questions answering. In this paper, we present the task of \emph{process extraction}, in which process events and their relations are automatically extracted from text. 
We first describe a novel graph representation for processes that includes a rich set of temporal, causal and co-reference relations between process events, and then characterize the structural properties of processes, such as \emph{connectivity} of the process graph. 
We develop a method that exploits these structural properties by performing joint inference over multiple relations over the graph structure. 
We demonstrate empirically that taking process structure into account significantly improves performance over a data set containing 150 descriptions of biological processes. We release this novel data set for the benefit of the research community.
