Biological processes are complex phenomena involving a series of events that are related to one another through multiple dependencies. Teaching computers to read, understand and reason over text describing biological processes could dramatically improve performance of semantic applications such as question answering (QA). In this paper, we present the task of \emph{process extraction}, in which the events in the process and their relations are automatically extracted from text. We represent processes by graphs whose edges describe a large set of temporal, causal and co-reference event-event relations, and characterize the structural properties of that graph (e.g., the graph is \emph{connected}). Then, we present a method for extracting relations between processes, which exploits these structural properties by performing joint inference over the set of possible extracted relations. On a novel data set (released with this paper), containing 148 descriptions of biological processes we show significant improvement comparing to baselines that ignore process structure.
