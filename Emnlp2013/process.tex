\section{Process Definition and Data Set}

A process description is a paragraph or sequence of tokens $\bx=\{x_1,\ldots x_{|\bx|}\}$ describing a series of events that are related by various temporal and causal relations. For example, in ATP synthesis, the event in which the rotor spins \emph{causes} the event where an internal rod spins. 

We define the process events and their relations by a directed graph  $\sP=(V,E)$, where the nodes $V=\{1,\ldots,|V|\}$ represent event mentions and labeled edges correspond to event-event relations. An event mention $v \in V$ is defined by a trigger $t_v$, which is a span of words $x_i,x_{i+1},\ldots,x_j$ and by a set of argument mentions $A_v$, where each argument mention $a_v \in A_v$ is also a span of words labeled by a semantic role $l$ taken from a set $\sL$. For example, in the first event mention of ATP synthesis $t_v=\mbox{\emph{flowing}}$, and one of the arguments is $a_v=\mbox{\emph{(H+ ions, \textsc{Agent})}}$. A labeled edge $(u,v,r)$ in the graph describes a relation $r \in \sR$ between the event mentions $u$ and $v$. The task of process extraction is, given text $\bx$\footnote{Argument mentions are also related by coreference relations, but we neglect that since it is not central in this paper.}, to extract the graph $\sP$ .

A natural way to break down process extraction into two steps is to first perform semantic role labeling (SRL), that is, identify triggers and predict argument mentions with their semantic role, and then extract event-event relations between pairs of event mentions. In this paper, we focus on the second task, where given a set of event triggers $\sT$, we find all event-event relations, where a trigger represents the entire event. For completeness, we now describe the semantic roles $\sL$ used in our data set, and then present the set of event-event relations $\sR$.

The set $\sL$ contains standard semantic roles such as \textsc{Agent}, \textsc{Theme}, \textsc{Origin}, \textsc{Destination} and \textsc{Location}. Two additional semantic roles were employed that are relevant for biological text: \textsc{Result} corresponds to an entity that is the result of an event, and \textsc{Raw-material} describes an entity that is used or consumed during an event. For example, for the last event \emph{`produce`} in Figure~\ref{fig:process}, \emph{`ATP`} is the \textsc{Result} of the event, while \emph{`ADP`} is the \textsc{Raw-material}.

The relation set $\sR$ contains the following relations (assuming an edge $(u,v,r)$):
\begin{enumerate}[itemsep=0pt,topsep=0pt] 
\item \textsc{Prev} denotes that $u$ is an event immediately before $v$. Thus, the edges $(u,v,\mbox{\textsc{Prev}})$ and $(v,w,\mbox{\textsc{Prev}})$, preclude the edge $(u,w,\mbox{\textsc{Prev}})$. For example, in ``When a photon \emph{strikes} \ldots energy is  \emph{passed} \ldots until it \emph{reaches} \ldots'', there is no edge (\emph{strikes}, \emph{reaches}, \textsc{Prev}) due to the intervening event \emph{`passed'}.
\item \textsc{Cotemp} denotes that events $u$ and $v$ overlap in time (e.g., the first two event mentions \emph{flowing} and \emph{enter} in Figure~\ref{fig:process}).
\item \textsc{Super} denotes that event $u$ includes event $v$. For instance, in ``During \emph{DNA replication}, DNA polymerases \emph{proofread} each nucleotide\ldots" there is an edge (\emph{DNA replication}, \emph{proofread}, \textsc{Super}).
\item \textsc{Causes} denotes that event $u$ causes event $v$ (e.g., the relation between \emph{changing} and \emph{spins} in sentence 2 of Figure ~\ref{fig:process}).
\item \textsc{Enables} denotes that event $u$ creates preconditions that allow event $v$ to take place. For example, the description ``\ldots cause cancer cells  to \emph{lose} attachments to neighboring cells\ldots, allowing them to \emph{spread} into nearby tissues" has the edge (\emph{lose}, \emph{spread}, \textsc{Enables}).
\item \textsc{Same} denotes that $u$ and $v$ co-refer to the same event (\emph{spins} and \emph{Spinning} in  Figure~\ref{fig:process}).
\end{enumerate}

Our relation set contains the relations \textsc{Causes} and \textsc{Enables}, which are important for modeling processes and go beyond just temporal ordering. The \textsc{Super} relation appears in temporal annotations such as the Timebank corpus \cite{Pustejovsky03} and in work on temporal logic \cite{Allen83}, but in practice it is not considered by many temporal ordering systems \cite{Chambers08,Yoshikawa09,Do12}. 

We also added event coreference (\textsc{Same}) to $\sR$. Do et al. \shortcite{Do12} used event coreference information in a temporal ordering task to modify probabilities provided by pairwise classifiers prior to joint inference. In this paper, we simply treat \textsc{Same} as another event-event relation, which allows us to easily perform joint inference and employ structural constraints that combine both coreference and temporal relations simultaneously. For example, if $u$ and $v$ are the same event, then it can not be for any $w$, that $u$ is before $w$, but $v$ is after $w$ (see Section~\ref{subsec:global})

We have annotated 148 process descriptions based on the aforementioned definitions and provide further details on annotation and data set statistics in Section~\ref{subsec:setup} and Table~\ref{tab:datastats}.

\paragraph{Structural properties of processes} 
Naturally, coherent processes exhibit many structural properties. For example, two argument mentions related to the same event can not overlap -- a constraint that has been used in the past in SRL \cite{Toutanova08}. In this paper we focus on three main structural properties of the graph $\sP$. First, in a coherent process all events mentioned are related to one another, and hence the graph $\sP$ must be connected. Second, processes tend to have a ``chain-like" structure where one event follows another, and thus we expect node degree to generally be $\leq 2$. Indeed, 90\% of event mentions have degree $\leq2$, as is demonstrated by the first column of Table~\ref{tab:degree}. Last, if we consider relations between all possible triple of events in a process, clearly some configurations are impossible, while others are quite common (illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:triad}). In Section~\ref{subsec:global}, we show that modeling these properties using a joint inference framework can improve the quality of process extraction significantly.
