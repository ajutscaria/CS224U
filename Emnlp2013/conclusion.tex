\section{Conclusion}

In this paper we presented the task of process extraction and a method for extracting processes. We focused on extracting relations between event triggers. We also release publicly a data set for the scientific community. We have shown that by taking advantage of the global structure of a process we can improve performance.

Future work - adding more constraints - Mengqiu's idea. This may results in inference problems (it does) and so we can try think of smarter inference. There is the problem of very little data and we can think about using data from other domains and do adaptations. We want to do the full pipeline jointly.
