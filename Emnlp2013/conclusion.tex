\section{Conclusion}

Developing systems that read and extract meaning from process descriptions is an important step towards applications that require deep reasoning, such as non-factoid QA. In this paper we have presented the task of process extraction, and developed methods for extracting relations between process events. Processes contain events that are  tightly coupled through strong mutual dependencies. We have shown that by exploiting these structural dependencies and performing joint inference over all event mentions we can significantly improve accuracy comparing to several baselines. We have also released a new data set containing 148 fully annotated descriptions of biological processes. Even though the models we built were trained on biological processes, the features and constraints we devised does not encode any domain specific information, and hence, should be extensible for datasets on any other domains.

We assumed in this paper that event triggers are given as input. In future work we would like to perform trigger identification jointly with extraction of event-event relations. Because data annotation is expensive, another important direction is to reduce annotation burden by using data from similar domains or large unannotated corpora. Last, we would like to combine our method in a QA system that uses the extracted structure to answer non-factoid questions that are unanswerable by current state-of-the-art systems.
