\section{Experimental Evaluation}

\subsection{Experimental setup} \label{subsec:setup}

Our data set consists of 148 process descriptions annotated by a biologist. The annotator was presented with annotation guidelines, annotated 20 descriptions and then annotations were discussed with the authors, after which all process descriptions were annotated. After training a second biologist, we measured inter-annotator agreement on 30 random process descriptions, resulting in agreement $\kappa=0.69$. 

Process descriptions were parsed with Stanford constituency and dependency parsers \cite{Klein03,Marneffe06}, and 35 process descriptions were set aside as a test set (\# of training set trigger pairs: 1932, \# of test set trigger pairs: 906). We performed 10-fold cross validation over the training set for feature selection and tuning of constraint parameters. For each constraint type (connectivity, chain-structure, and five triangle constraints) we introduced a parameter and tuned the seven parameters by coordinate-wise ascent, where for hard constraints a binary parameter controls whether the constraint is used, and for soft constraints we attempted 10 different reward/penalty values. Last, for our global model we defined $\theta_{ijr}=\log p_{ijr}$, where $p_{ijr}$ is the probability given by the local classifier.

We test the following systems: (a) \emph{All-Prev}: since the most common process structure is a chain of consecutive events we simply predict \textsc{Next} for every two adjacent triggers. (b) \emph{Local$_{base}$}: A pairwise classifier with features from previous work (Section~\ref{subsec:pairwise}) (c) \emph{Local} A pairwise classifier with all features (Section~\ref{subsec:pairwise-novel}) (d) \emph{Global}: Our full model that uses ILP inference.

%(d) \emph{Local$_{chain}$}: For every two adjacent triggers we pick the highest probability non-\textsc{None} relation using the local classifier. Again, this uses the assumption that many processes have a chain-structure.

To evaluate system performance we compare the set of predictions on all trigger pairs to the gold standard annotations and compute micro-averaged precision, recall and F$_1$. We perform two types of evaluations: (a) \emph{Full}: evaluation on our full set of 11 relations (b) \emph{Temporal:} Evaluation on temporal relations only, by collapsing \textsc{Prev}, \textsc{Causes}, and \textsc{Enables} to a single category and similarly for \textsc{Next}, \textsc{Caused}, and \textsc{Enabled} (inter-annotator agreement $\kappa=0.75$). We computed statistical significance of our results with the paired bootstrap resampling method \cite{efron1993}.

Table~\ref{tab:results} presents performance of all systems. Our main result is that using global constraints improves performance on all measures in both full and temporal evaluations. Particularly, in the full evaluation recall improves by 12\% and overall F$_1$ improves significantly by 3.7 points against \emph{Local} ($p<0.01$). Recall improvement suggests that modeling connectivity allowed \emph{Global} to add correct relations in cases where some events were not connected to one another.

The full \emph{Local} classifier substantially outperforms \emph{Local$_{base}$}. This indicates that our novel features (Section~\ref{subsec:pairwise-novel}) are important for discriminating between process relations. Specifically, in the full evaluation \emph{Local} improves precision more than in the temporal evaluation, suggesting that designing syntactic and semantic features for connectives is useful for distinguishing \textsc{Next}, \textsc{Causes}, and \textsc{Enables} when the amount of training data is small.

The \emph{All-Prev} baseline performs quite badly in the full evaluation, but in temporal evaluation it performs reasonably well. This demonstrates the strong tendency process descriptions have to proceed linearly from one event to the other, which is a general property of discourse structure \cite{schegloff73}.

Table~\ref{tab:degree} presents the degree distribution of \emph{Local} and \emph{Global} on the development set comparing to the gold standard. Clearly, degree distribution of \emph{Global} is much more similar to the gold standard than \emph{Local}. In particular, the connectivity constraint ensures that there are no isolated nodes and shifts mass from nodes with degree $0$ and $1$ to nodes with degree $2$.

Table~\ref{tab:paramtuning} presents the order in which global constraints were introduced into the model using coordinate ascent on the development set. Connectivity is the first constraint to be introduced, and improves performance considerably. The chain constraint, on the other hand, is included third, which can be explained by examining the distribution of degrees in Table~\ref{tab:degree}. The predictions of \emph{Local} do not have many nodes with degree $>2$ and thus the effect of this constraint is smaller. As for triangle constraints, we see that four constraints are included in the model but one is discarded, since the changes they caused to the final solution did not improve F$_1$ on the development set.

%Table~\ref{} is a confusion matrix showing that it is hard to distinguish Causes, PrevEvent, and Cotemporal. These are not handled by global constraints and to handle this need other types of information.

\subsection{Qualitative Analysis} \label{subsec:analysis}

Figure~\ref{fig:graph} shows two examples where the global constraints improve the predictions made by the local model. In (a), the local model fails to predict relations \emph{skipped}-\emph{deleted} and \emph{used}-\emph{duplicated}, probably because they are not close by and in two different sentences. Now, the global model enforces the connectivity constraint which makes sure that \emph{deleted} and \emph{duplicated} are related to at least one another trigger. In this case, the global model predicts the relations correctly.

In (b), the local model predicts a triad which is not possible. This is because \emph{bind} and \emph{binds} cannot be the same event with an event \emph{secrete} happening between them. At the same time, since \emph{bind} and \emph{binds} shares the same lemma, the local model has good reason to predict that these are same events. Once the global model enforces the constraints, it finds that the relation triangle is not feasible and as result corrects the prediction of the local model to NONE. It could very well have been possible that instead of making the relation between \emph{bind} and \emph{binds} to NONE, it could have removed the relation between \emph{secrete} and \emph{binds}. The global model picks the configuration that maximizes the objective.

We see that the connectivity constraints help to identify the relation between \emph{produce} and \emph{passed} \textcolor{red}{TODO} FIND TWO MORE INTERESTING EXAMLPES AND DISCUSS AND SOME ERROR ANALYSIS
