H+ ions flowing down their gradient enter a half channel in a stator, which is anchored in the membrane. H+ ions enter binding sites within a rotor, changing the shape of each subunit so that the rotor spins within the membrane. Spinning of the rotor causes an internal rod to spin as well. Turning of the rod activates catalytic sites in the knob that can produce ATP from ADP and P_i.
