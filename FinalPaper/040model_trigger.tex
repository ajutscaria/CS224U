\subsection{Event trigger prediction}
As we mentioned earlier, events are represented as pre-terminal nodes in the parse tree of a sentence. As a first step to the task, we built a baseline model that predicted every pre-terminal node whose part-of-speech tag started with 'VB' to be an event trigger. This model performed quite well giving an F1 score of 0.565, considering that it was a very naive approach. As the next step, we designed a MaxEnt model that trained on the annotated samples using several lexical and path features. The features we currently have include part-of-speech tag of the word, its lemma, the part-of-speech tag of its parent, the actual word itself and the path from root to the node. The results we have are in Table~\ref{table:eventprediction}. On doing error analysis, we found that our classifier fails to identify nominalized verb forms as event triggers. We used NomLex and NomBank, which are collections of nominalizations, to include a feature that indicates nominalization. NomLex proved useful and the classification accuracy improved quite significantly.
