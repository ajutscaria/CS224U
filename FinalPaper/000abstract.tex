The web has an enormous amount of information stored as text content. Designing automated mechanisms to create knowledge bases using the content of the web and building automatic question answering systems have been an area of research for many years. In this project, we aim to build a system that can extract events, their associated entities and assign semantic roles to the entities that are not specific to any domain. We achieve this by first predicting event triggers and using these triggers to predict their arguments. Since the models are not joint, there are cascading errors that result in low recall. We overcome this by a technique called iterative optimization which makes use of the fact that identifying entities in a sentence can help us predict event triggers better. Thus, we predict entities associated with triggers and also predict triggers from the entities identified iteratively till we reach an optimal stage.
