Event extraction is a promising area of research that will find a lot of application with the ever-increasing amount of data being generated. This is because of the increase in both newly published material and also with many popular books and articles being converted to electronic format. In this paper, we present a set of models for event and entity extraction with semantic role labeling. We have a basic trigger prediction model and an entity prediction model that predicts event triggers. Since we found that knowledge of entities can help to predict event triggers, we devised the iterative optimization algorithm that iteratively improves trigger and its argument prediction. Following this, we developed a dynamic programming approach for semantic role labeling.

We feel that combining the features from parse tree and dependency tree is something that hasn't been extensively used before and it proves very helpful. Also, the iterative approach to event and entity prediction works well considering the simplicity of the model. Further work would include adding semantic role labeling also into the iterative algorithm and also to include a termporal ordering of events to form a chain of events making a story.
