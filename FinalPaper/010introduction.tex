The World Wide Web is accessible to anyone with an internet connection. But analyzing this vast amount of data to extract meaningful information is difficult because of its sheer volume. Extracting content from the web to build knowledge bases is an active area of research. For instance, extracting events and the associated entities from biomedical and molecular biology text has drawn a lot of attention, especially because of the introduction of BIONLP tasks targeting fine-grained information extraction.  The knowledge bases built by information extraction systems can find application in a variety of fields, for example, to supplement the structured information available to build question answering systems.

In this paper, we focus on the task of event and entity extraction, with semantic role labeling. The prior literature in this field shows that the task of extracting information from text is possible with reasonable accuracy levels.  But, the performance of the state-of-the-art systems is still quite distant to that of a ’perfect’ extraction system. This is mostly because interpreting meaning from complex structures of natural language is a hard task. In this work, we combine the representations, feature extraction methods and models adopted in the previous work. We also introduce an iterative method to combine event and entity extraction that can benefit each other and leads to a model that is superior to the independent models. This reduces the cascading errors that are common in independent models.
