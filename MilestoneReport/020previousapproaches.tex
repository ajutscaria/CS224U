Most of the work in the area of event and entity extraction can be categorized by different criteria:

\begin{itemize}

\item \xhdr{Coverage and domain} Most of the previous work dealt only with a subset of the tasks listed as the project goals and dealt with very specific domains which would not generalize.

\item \xhdr{Parsing scheme: Constituency vs Dependency parse} Some of the previous work relied on the constituency parse structure of sentences, while others used just the dependency parse structure.

\item \xhdr{Modeling: Graph vs Tree} Some of the earlier work is based on graphs and deals with edge prediction, while others use tree structure with classification of nodes.

\end{itemize}
