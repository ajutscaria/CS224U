In this project, the dataset was prepared by annotating 125 paragraphs from different chapters from the text book {\em Biology (Eighth Edition)} by {\em Neil A. Campbell} and {\em Jane B. Reece}. Each paragraph is a text file and has an associated annotation file that indicates the different events and entities (by their character offsets in the original paragraph) and the event-entity and event-event relationships. The annotations were done by experts in the field (they were employees of a company named Vulcan). Since there is not much data at our disposal, we split the data by a proportion of 70-30 for training and testing. We are using 10 fold cross validation (by randomly ordering the files to avoid similarities in files near each other) on the training set and all results presented are using this.
