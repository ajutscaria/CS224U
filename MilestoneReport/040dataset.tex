In this project, the dataset was prepared by annotating 125 paragraphs from different chapters of the text book {\em Biology (Eighth Edition)} by {\em Neil A. Campbell} and {\em Jane B. Reece}. Each paragraph is a text file and has an associated annotation file that indicates the different events and entities (by their character offsets in the original paragraph) and the event-entity and event-event relationships. The annotations were done by experts in the field (employees of the company Vulcan). Since there is not much data at our disposal, we split the data by a proportion of 70-30\% for training and testing. We randomly permute the order of files to avoid similarities in adjacent files and then use 10 fold cross validation on the training set. For event prediction, we use F1 score based on the trigger predictions made. In entity prediction, the F1 score is based on whether an entity was predicted correctly along with its association with the corresponding event.
