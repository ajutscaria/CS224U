In this project, the dataset was prepared by annotating 125 paragraphs from different chapters from the text book {\em Biology (Eighth Edition)} by {\em Neil A. Campbell} and {\em Jane B. Reece}. Each paragraph is a text file and has an associated annotation file that indicates the different events and entities (by their character offsets in the original paragraph) and the event-entity and event-event relationships. The annotations were done by experts in the field (they were employees of a company named Vulcan).
