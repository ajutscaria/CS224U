In the literature review, we focused on research publications in the areas of event and entity extraction with semantic role labeling and temporal ordering of events. Even though there has been a lot of work on one (or some) of these areas in isolation, there is no approach that seamlessly integrates all these components together. Through this project, we envision to build a system that takes a paragraph of text as input and does the following tasks:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Identify the events by locating the trigger words.
\item For each event, identify its arguments (only entities).
\item For each argument that is associated with a specific event, label the association with a semantic role, like Agent, Destination, Theme, Location etc.
\end{enumerate}
