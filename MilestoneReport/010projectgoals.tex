In the literature review, we focused on research publications in the areas of event and entity extraction with semantic role labeling and temporal ordering of events. Even though there has been a lot of work on one (or some) of these areas in isolation, there is no approach that seamlessly integrates all these components together. Without a system that can do all these tasks together, it is impossible to extract any meaningful information from the enormous amount of text content we have. For instance, most of the work on entity extraction and semantic role labeling assumes that the trigger word indicating an event is given. While these papers give us a good indication that these tasks can be done with reasonable performance, the task of automatic information extraction from text (specifically those describing a phenomenon or process) remains largely unsolved. Through this project, we envision to build a system that takes a paragraph of text as input and does the following:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Identify the events by locating the trigger words.
\item For each event, identify its arguments (only entities).
\item For each argument that is associated with a specific event, label the association with a semantic role, like Agent, Destination, Theme, Location etc.
\item Identify event-event relations that denotes the temporal ordering between events, like Cotemporal, NextEvent etc.
\end{enumerate}
