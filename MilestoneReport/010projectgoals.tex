In the literature review, we focused on research publications in the areas of event and entity extraction with semantic role labeling and temporal ordering of events. Even though there has been a lot of work on one (or some) of these areas in isolation, there is no approach that seamlessly integrates all these components together. Without a system that can do all these tasks together, it is impossible to extract any meaningful information from the enormous amount of text content we have. For instance, most of the work on entity extraction and semantic role labeling assumes that the trigger word indicating an event is given. While these papers give us a good indication that these tasks can be done with reasonable performance, the task of automatic information extraction remains largely unsolved. Through this project, we envision to
